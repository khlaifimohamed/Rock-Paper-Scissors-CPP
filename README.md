# Rock-Paper-Scissors-CPP
In this project, I built a Rock-Paper-Scissors game in C++ from scratch, focusing on clean structure and modular design. I broke the logic into reusable functions and used enums to make the game choices and winner logic clear and maintainable. I also created custom structs to organize round data and overall game information, which helped me understand how to manage state and store match history efficiently. Throughout this project, I learned how to handle user input safely, generate random computer choices, and separate game logic from UI to keep the code readable and scalable. This project was a solid exercise in applying core programming concepts like control flow, structured data, and modularity â€” and it definitely boosted my confidence in C++.
